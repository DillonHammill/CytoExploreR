**CytoExploreR** is designed to provide an interactive interface for the analysis of cytometry data in R. If you are new to **CytoExploreR** visit https://dillonhammill.github.io/CytoExploreR/ to get started. 

# Installation
**CytoExploreR** is built on the existing flow cytometry infrastructure for R developed by the [RGLab](https://github.com/RGLab). In order to properly install **CytoExploreR** and its dependencies the following platform-specific tools are required:

## Windows and Linux
flowWorkspace requires additional C++ libraries to build from source using Rtools for windows users. Windows and Linux users should follow these [instructions](https://github.com/RGLab/flowWorkspace/blob/trunk/INSTALL) before proceeding.

## Mac
Mac users will need to ensure that **XQuartz** is in their list of installed Applications. **XQuartz** is commonly found in the utilities folder. If **XQuartz** is missing from your list of applications it can be installed from this [link](https://www.xquartz.org/). Restart your computer following installation. 

## flowCore, flowWorkspace & openCyto
Once these tools are installed, users can proceed to installing the latest versions of [flowCore](https://github.com/RGLab/flowCore), [flowWorkspace](https://github.com/RGLab/flowWorkspace) and [openCyto](https://github.com/RGLab/openCyto) from Bioconductor.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Bioconductor
install.packages("BiocManager")
# Install flowCore, flowWorkspace and openCyto
library(BiocManager)
install(c("flowCore", "flowWorkspace", "openCyto"))
```

## CytoExploreR

Once these packages are successfully installed, users will need to install **CytoExploreRData** which contains example datasets which will be used to demonstrate the features of **CytoExploreR**. **CytoExploreR** can then be installed from GitHub.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# CytoExploreRData development version on GitHub
devtools::install_github("DillonHammill/CytoExploreRData")
# CytoExploreR development version on GitHub
devtools::install_github("DillonHammill/CytoExploreR", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

# Usage

The full details of how **CytoExploreR** works will be tackled individually in the package vignettes, but a succinct usage outline is described below:

1. Compensation of fluorescent spillover
  
    1.1 Load compensation controls into a `ncdfFlowSet`
        
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(CytoExploreR)
    library(CytoExploreRData)
  
    # Save .fcs files to folder "Compensation Controls" in working directory
    files <- list.files(path = "Compensation Controls", full.names = TRUE)
    fs <- read.ncdfFlowSet(files = files)
    ```
    
    1.2 Load compensation controls into `GatingSet` for gating
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Add flowSet to GatingSet
    gs <- GatingSet(fs)
    ```
    
    1.3 Gate Single Cells using `cyto_gate_draw`
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Gate Cells
    cyto_gate_draw(gs, 
              parent = "root",
              alias = "Cells",
              channels = c("FSC-A","SSC-A"),
              type = "polygon",
              gatingTemplate = "Compensation-gatingTemplate.csv")
    
    # Gate Single Cells
        cyto_gate_draw(gs, 
              parent = "Cells",
              alias = "Single Cells",
              channels = c("FSC-A","FSC-H"),
              type = "polygon",
              gatingTemplate = "Compensation-gatingTemplate.csv")
    ```
    
    ```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    library(CytoExploreR)
    library(CytoExploreRData)
    
    gs <- GatingSet(Compensation)
    gt_gating(Compensation_gatingTemplate, gs)
    ```
    
    ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', out.height='100%',fig.align="center"}
    knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/README-Compensation-gates.png')
    ```
    
    1.4 Compute fluorescent spillover matrix using `cyto_spillover_compute`
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    cyto_spillover_compute(gs, 
                      parent = "Single Cells")
    ```
  
    1.5 Interactively edit computed spillover matrix using `cyto_spillover_edit`
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    cyto_spillover_edit(gs, 
                   parent = "Single Cells", 
                   channel_match = "Compensation-Channels.csv",

                      header = TRUE, 
                      row.names = 1)
    colnames(spill) <- rownames(spill)
    
    # Apply compensation to samples
    gs <- compensate(gs, spill)
    ```

    2.5 Transform fluorescent channels for gating
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Fluorescent channels
    chans <- cyto_fluor_channels(gs)
    
    # Logicle transformation

              channels = c("FSC-A","SSC-A"),
              gatingTemplate = "Example-gatingTemplate.csv")
    
    # Copy above & edit to add new population(s)
    # Repeat until gating scheme is complete
    ```
    
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', out.height='60%',fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/README-gate_draw.gif')

4. Export population-level statistics using `cyto_stats_compute`

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(CytoExploreR)
library(CytoExploreRData)
fs <- Activation
gs <- GatingSet(fs)
gs <- compensate(gs, fs[[1]]@description$SPILL)
trans <- estimateLogicle(gs[[4]], cyto_fluor_channels(gs))
gs <- transform(gs, trans)
gt <- gatingTemplate(system.file("extdata", "Activation-gatingTemplate.csv", package = "CytoExploreRData"))
gt_gating(gt,gs)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cyto_stats_compute(gs,
                   alias = c("CD4 T Cells","CD8 T Cells"),

Users should refer to the [Changelog](https://dillonhammill.github.io/CytoExploreR/news/index.html) before installing new versions of the package.

# Credits

**CytoExploreR** would not be possible without the existing flow cytometry infrastructure developed by the RGLab. **CytoExploreR** started out as simple plugin for openCyto to facilitate gate drawing but has evolved into a fully-fledged flow cytometry analysis package thanks to the support and guidance of members of the RGLab. Please take the time to check out their work on [GitHub](https://github.com/RGLab).

# Development

**CytoExploreR** is a maturing package which will continue to be sculpted by the feedback and feature requests of users. The GitHub `master` branch will always contain the most stable build of the package. New features and updates will be made to a separate branch and merged to the `master` branch when stable and tested. The [Changelog](https://dillonhammill.github.io/CytoExploreR/news/index.html) will reflect any changes made to the `master` branch.
