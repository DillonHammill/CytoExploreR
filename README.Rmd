**CytoRSuite** is designed to provide an interactive interface for the analysis of flow cytometry data in R. If you are new to **CytoRSuite** visit https://dillonhammill.github.io/CytoRSuite/ to get started.

# Installation

**CytoRSuite** is built on the existing flow cytometry infrastructure for R developed by the [RGLab](https://github.com/RGLab). In order to properly install **CytoRSuite** and its dependencies the following platform-specific tools are required:

## Windows and Linux
flowWorkspace requires additional C++ libraries to build from source using Rtools for windows users. Windows and Linux users should follow these [instructions](https://github.com/RGLab/flowWorkspace/blob/trunk/INSTALL) before proceeding.

## Mac
Mac users will need to ensure that **XQuartz** is in their list of installed Applications. **XQuartz** is commonly found in the utilities folder. If **XQuartz** is missing from your list of applications it can be installed from this [link](https://www.xquartz.org/). Restart your computer following installation. 

## flowCore, flowWorkspace & openCyto
Once these tools are installed, users can proceed to installing the release versions of [flowCore](https://github.com/RGLab/flowCore), [flowWorkspace](https://github.com/RGLab/flowWorkspace) and [openCyto](https://github.com/RGLab/openCyto) from Bioconductor.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Bioconductor
install.packages("BiocManager")

# Install flowCore, flowWorkspace and openCyto
library(BiocManager)
install(c("flowCore", "flowWorkspace", "openCyto"))
```

## CytoRSuite

Once these packages are successfully installed, users will need to install **CytoRSuiteData** which contains example datasets which will be used to demonstrate the features of **CytoRSuite**. **CytoRSuite** can then be installed from GitHub.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# CytoRSuiteData development version on GitHub
devtools::install_github("DillonHammill/CytoRSuiteData")

# CytoRSuite development version on GitHub
devtools::install_github("DillonHammill/CytoRSuite", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

# Overview

**CytoRSuite** provides an interactive interface for analysis of flow cytometry data. Some key features include:

* user guided automatic compensation using `spillover_compute`
* interactively modify spillover matrices using `spillover_edit`
* visualise compensation in all channels using `cyto_plot_compensation`
* easily associate experimental details with each file using `cyto_annotate`
* manual gate drawing using `gate_draw`
* ability to edit drawn gates using `gate_edit`
* remove gates using `gate_remove`
* gate saving directly to an openCyto `gatingTemplate` for future use
* support for using both manual and automated gating approaches through linking to `openCyto`
* visualisation of flowFrames, flowSets, GatingHierarchies and GatingSets using `cyto_plot`
* visualisation of complete gating strategies with back-gating and/or gate tracking using `cyto_plot_gating_scheme`
* visualisation of marker expression profiles in all channels using `cyto_plot_profile`
* export population level statistics using `cyto_stats_compute`

# Usage

The full details of how **CytoRSuite** works will be tackled individually in the package vignettes, but a succinct usage outline is described below:

1. Compensation of fluorescent spillover
  
    1.1 Load compensation controls into a `ncdfFlowSet`
        
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(CytoRSuite)
    library(CytoRSuiteData)
  
    # Save .fcs files to folder "Compensation Controls" in working directory
    files <- list.files(path = "Compensation Controls", full.names = TRUE)
    fs <- read.ncdfFlowSet(files = files)
    ```
    
    1.2 Load compensation controls into `GatingSet` for gating
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Add flowSet to GatingSet
    gs <- GatingSet(fs)
    ```
    
    1.3 Gate Single Cells using `gate_draw`
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Gate Cells
    gate_draw(gs, 
              parent = "root",
              alias = "Cells",
              channels = c("FSC-A","SSC-A"),
              type = "polygon",
              gatingTemplate = "Compensation-gatingTemplate.csv")
    
    # Gate Single Cells
        gate_draw(gs, 
              parent = "Cells",
              alias = "Single Cells",
              channels = c("FSC-A","FSC-H"),
              type = "polygon",
              gatingTemplate = "Compensation-gatingTemplate.csv")
    ```
    
    ```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    library(CytoRSuite)
    library(CytoRSuiteData)
    
    gs <- GatingSet(Compensation)
    gating(Compensation_gatingTemplate, gs)
    
    par(mfrow = c(1,2))
    cyto_plot(gs, parent = "root", alias = "Cells", channels = c("FSC-A","SSC-A"), group_by = "all", layout = FALSE)
    cyto_plot(gs, parent = "Cells", alias = "Single Cells", channels = c("FSC-A","FSC-H"), group_by = "all", layout = FALSE)
    par(mfrow = c(1,1))
    ```
    
    1.4 Compute fluorescent spillover matrix using `spillover_compute`
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    spillover_compute(gs, 
                      parent = "Single Cells")
    ```
  
    1.5 Interactively edit computed spillover matrix using `spillover_edit`
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    spillover_edit(gs, 
                   parent = "Single Cells", 
                   channel_match = "Compensation-Channels.csv", 
                   spillover = "Spillover-Matrix.csv")
    ```
    
    ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', out.height='100%',fig.align="center"}
    knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/README-spillover_edit.png')
    ```
    
2. Analyse samples

    2.1 Load samples into a `ncdfFlowSet`
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Save samples to folder "Samples" in working directory
    files <- list.files(path = "Samples", full.names = TRUE)
    fs <- read.ncdfFlowSet(files = files)
    ```

    2.2 Annotate samples with markers using `cyto_markers`
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    cyto_markers(fs)
    ```
    
    ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='40%', out.height='40%',fig.align="center"}
    knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/README-cyto_markers.png')
    ```
    
    2.3 Annotate samples with experimental details using `cyto_annotate`

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    cyto_annotate(fs)
    ```

    ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='30%', out.height='30%',fig.align="center"}
    knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/README-cyto_annotate.png')
    ```

    2.4 Add samples to GatingSet
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    gs <- GatingSet(fs)
    ```

    2.4 Apply fluorescent compensation

    # Load in spillover matrix
    spill <- read.csv("Spillover-Matrix.csv", 
                      header = TRUE, 
                      row.names = 1)
    colnames(spill) <- rownames(spill)
    
    # Apply compensation to samples
    gs <- compensate(gs, spill)
    ```

    2.5 Transform fluorescent channels for gating
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Fluorescent channels
    chans <- cyto_fluor_channels(gs)
    
    # Logicle transformation
    trans <- estimateLogicle(gs[[4]], chans)
    gs <- transform(gs, trans)
    ```
    
    2.6 Build gating scheme using `gate_draw`
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Cells
    gate_draw(gs,
              parent = "Cells",
              alias = "Cells",
              channels = c("FSC-A","SSC-A"),
              gatingTemplate = "Example-gatingTemplate.csv")
    
    # Copy above & edit to add new population(s)
    # Repeat until gating scheme is complete
    ```
    
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', out.height='60%',fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/README-gate_draw.gif')
```
    
3. Visualise gating schemes using `cyto_plot_gating_scheme`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cyto_plot_gating_scheme(gs[[4]], back_gate = TRUE)
```
  
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', out.height='100%',fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/README-cyto_plot_gating_scheme.png')
```
  
4. Export population-level statistics using `cyto_stats_compute`

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(CytoRSuite)
library(CytoRSuiteData)

fs <- Activation

fluor <- cyto_fluor_channels(fs)
chnls <- c("Alexa Fluor 405-A","Alexa Fluor 430-A","APC-Cy7-A", "PE-A", "Alexa Fluor 488-A", "Alexa Fluor 700-A", "Alexa Fluor 647-A", "7-AAD-A") 
markers <- c("Hoechst-405", "Hoechst-430", "CD11c", "Va2", "CD8", "CD4", "CD44", "CD69")
names(markers) <- chnls
markernames(fs) <- markers

pData(fs)$OVAConc <- c(0,0.005,0.05,0.5)

gs <- GatingSet(fs)
gs <- compensate(gs, fs[[1]]@description$SPILL)

trans <- estimateLogicle(gs[[4]], cyto_fluor_channels(gs))
gs <- transform(gs, trans)

gt <- gatingTemplate(system.file("extdata", "Activation-gatingTemplate.csv", package = "CytoRSuiteData"))
gating(gt,gs)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cyto_stats_compute(gs,
                   alias = c("CD4 T Cells","CD8 T Cells"),
