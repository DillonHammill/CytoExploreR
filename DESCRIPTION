Description: An intuitive and interactive approach to cytometry analysis in R. 
  CytoExploreR contains tools for every stage of the analysis pipeline including 
  user-guided automatic compensation, realtime editing of spillover matrices, 
  manual gate drawing, gate editing, visualisation of all existing cytometry 
  objects and export of population level statistics for further analysis. Furthermore,
  through linking to openCyto, CytoExploreR provides the tools necessary to easily combine 
  manual and automated gating approaches in R.
