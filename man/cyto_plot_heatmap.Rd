\title{Construct a heatmap of cytometry data}
\usage{
\method{cyto_plot_heatmap}{flowSet}(x, channels = NULL, stat = "median", merge_by = NULL, ...)

\method{cyto_plot_heatmap}{flowFrame}(x, channels = NULL, stat = "median", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{obejct of class \code{flowFrame}, \code{flowSet},
\code{GatingHierarchy} or \code{GatingSet}.}

\item{channels}{names of the channels or markers for which statistics should
be calculated, set all channels with assigned markers by default.}

\item{stat}{name of the statistic passed to \code{\link{cyto_stats_compute}}
to perform the calculation, set to \code{median} by default to compute
median fluorescent intensity in the selected channels.}

\item{merge_by}{vector of experiment variable names to merge the samples into
groups prior to constructing the heatmap, set to NULL by default.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{heat_map()} to construct the
heatmap.}

\item{alias}{names of the populations for which the statistics should be
calculated, set to NULL by default.}

\item{parent}{names of the parent populations for which frequency statistics
should be calculated.}

\description{
The \code{HeatmapR} package is required for heatmap construction, it can be
downloaded by running
\code{devtools::install_github("DillonHammill/HeatmapR")} in the console.
