\usage{
cyto_channel_match(
  x,
  channels = NULL,
  file = NULL,
  save_as = NULL,
  strip = TRUE,
  ignore.case = TRUE,
  insertions = FALSE,
  label = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class \code{\link[flowWorkspace:cytoset]{cytoset}},
\code{\link[flowWorkspace:GatingHierarchy-class]{GatingHierarchy}} or
\code{\link[flowWorkspace:GatingSet-class]{GatingSet}}.}

\item{channels}{names of the possible channels or markers to be matched to
each control, set to all area fluorescent parameters by default.}

\item{file}{name of a CSV file from which the channel matching information
should be inherited. If not supplied, \code{cyto_channel_match()} will
automatically search for a file named \code{"Compensation-Details.csv"} or
create interactively create such a file.}

\item{save_as}{name of a CSV file to which the channel matching should be
written for downstream use, set to \code{"Compensation-Details.csv"}
prefixed with the date by default. Users can set custom file names here,
but the file name should contain \code{"Compensation-Details.csv"} in order
to be automatically detected by CytoExploreR within
\code{cyto_spillover_compute()}, \code{cyto_spillover_edit()},
\code{cyto_spillover_spread()} and \code{cyto_plot_compensation()}.}

\item{strip}{logical indicating whether overlapping characters in file names
should be stripped prior to matching, set to TRUE by default for more
accurate matching.}

\item{ignore.case}{logical indicating whether all case insensitive matches
should be found, set to TRUE by default.}

\item{insertions}{logical indicating whether character insertions are allowed
when matching the marker/channel combinations to the sample names, set to
FALSE by default to only allow deletions.}

\item{label}{logicla to indicate whether a \code{label} column is required in
the case of spectral unmxing, set to FALSE by default.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{link{grep}} when performing
character matching.}
}
\value{
a data.frame written to a CSV file containing information matching
  each file name to a channel. This channel matching information is also
  automatically added to the \code{cyto_details()} of the supplied samples
  where it can be easily accessed by CytoExploreR downstream.
