\arguments{
\item{x}{either an object of class
\code{\link[flowWorkspace:cytoframe]{cytoframe}},
\code{\link[flowWorkspace:cytoset]{cytoset}},
\code{\link[flowWorkspace:GatingHierarchy-class]{GatingHierarchy}},
\code{\link[flowWorkspace:GatingSet-class]{GatingSet}} or a list containing
cytoframe or cytoset objects.}

\item{parent}{name of the parent population to extract from GatingHierarchy
or GatingSet objects.}

\item{channels}{names of the channels used to construct the plot.}

\item{overlay}{optional argument if x is a cytoframe to overlay a list of
cytoframe objects.}

\item{display}{controls the number or percentage of events to display, set to
1 by default to display all events.}

\item{point_shape}{shape(s) to use for points in 2-D scatterplots, set to
\code{"."} by default to maximise plotting speed.  See
\code{\link[graphics:par]{pch}} for alternatives.}

\item{point_size}{numeric to control the size of points in 2-D scatter plots
set to 2 by default.}

\item{point_col_scale}{vector of ordered colours to use for the density
colour gradient of points.}

\item{point_cols}{vector colours to draw from when selecting colours for
points if none are supplied to point_col.}

\item{point_col}{colour(s) to use for points in 2-D scatter plots, set to NA
by default to use a blue-red density colour scale.}

\item{point_col_alpha}{numeric [0,1] to control point colour transparency in
2-D scatter plots, set to 1 by default to use solid colours.}

\item{point_fast}{logical indicating whether points should be plotted using
the \code{scattermore} package, set to FALSE by default. This is an
optional feature so if you intend to use it, make sure that you have the
scattermore package installed \code{install.packages("scattermore")}.}

\item{contour_lines}{numeric indicating the number of levels to use for
contour lines, set to 0 by default to exclude contour lines.}

\item{contour_line_type}{type of line to use for contour lines, set to 1 by
default.}

\item{contour_line_width}{line width for contour lines, set to 2 by default.}

\item{contour_line_col}{colour to use for contour lines, set to "black" by
default.}

\item{contour_line_alpha}{numeric [0,1] to control transparency of contour
lines, set to 1 by default to remove transparency.}

\item{seed}{numeric passed to \code{\link{set.seed}} to ensure that the same
sampling is applied with each \code{\link{cyto_plot_contour}} call, set to
an arbitrary numeric by default. This behaviour can be turned off by
setting this argument to NULL.}

\item{...}{not in use.}
