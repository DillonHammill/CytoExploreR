\title{Plot Compensation in All Fluorescent Channels - GatingSet Method}
\usage{
\S4method{cyto_plot_compensation}{GatingSet}(x, parent = NULL,
  channel_match = NULL, compensate = FALSE, spillover = NULL,
  axes_trans = NULL, overlay = TRUE, layout, popup = FALSE,
  title = NA, header = NA, header_text_font = 2,
  header_text_size = 1, header_text_col = "black", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class
\code{\link[flowWorkspace:GatingSet-class]{GatingSet}} containing gated
compensation controls and an unstained control.}

\item{parent}{name of the population to plot.}

\item{channel_match}{name of a csv file with two columns, the first called
"name" lists the names of each compensation control and the second
"channel" lists the fluorescent channel associated with each of the
compensation controls. Use "Unstained" in the channel column for the
universal unstained control. No need to construct this file manually as
users will be guided through this process if the \code{channel_match} is
missing.}

\item{compensate}{logical indicating whether the samples should be
compensated prior to plotting, set to FALSE by default. If no spillover
matrix is supplied to the spillover_file argument the spillover matrix will
extracted from the samples.}

\item{spillover}{name of spillover matrix csv file including .csv file
extension to apply to samples when \code{compensate} is TRUE. If no
\code{spillover} is supplied the spillover matrix will be extracted
directly from the \code{GatingSet} and applied to the samples when
\code{compensate} is TRUE.}

\item{axes_trans}{object of class
\code{\link[flowCore:transformList-class]{transformList}} or
\code{\link[flowWorkspace]{transformerList}} generated by
\code{\link[flowCore:logicleTransform]{estimateLogicle}} which was used to
transform the fluorescent channels of the supplied flowFrame. This
transform object will be used internally to ensure axes labels of the plot
are appropriately transformed. The transform object will NOT be applied to
the flowFrame internally and should be applied to the flowFrame prior to
plotting.}

\item{overlay}{logical indicating whether the unstained control should be
overlaid onto the plot if supplied in the flowSet, set to \code{TRUE} by
default.}

\item{layout}{vector of grid dimensions \code{c(#rows,#columns)} for each
plot.}

\item{popup}{logical indicating whether plots should be constructed in a
pop-up window.}

\item{title}{text to include above each plot, set to NA by default to remove
titles.}

\item{header}{vector of titles to use for the plots, set to the name of the
sample by default.}

\item{header_text_font}{font to use for header text, set to 2 by default.}

\item{header_text_size}{text size for header, set to 1 by default.}

\item{header_text_col}{colour for header text, set to "black" by default.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to
\code{\link{cyto_plot,flowFrame-method}}.}
}
\description{
Plot each compensation control in all fluorescent channels to identify any
potential compensation issues. The unstained control is overlaid in black as
a reference.
