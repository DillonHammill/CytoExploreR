# 1. Introduction

**CytoRSuite** provides a variety of useful gating functions to interactively draw gates around populations for the analysis of flow cytometry data. Here we will demonstrate the use of these functions to return `flowCore` gate objects for downstream analyses. Below we outline the gating functions currently supported by **CytoRSuite** as well as their required inputs:

* `gate_polygon_draw` - constructs **polygonGate(s)** based on selection of a minimum of 3 points. Polygon gates are sealed by right clicking and selecting "stop".
* `gate_rectangle_draw` - constructs **rectangleGate(s)** based on selection of 2 diagonal points defining the limits of the gate.
* `gate_boundary_draw` - constructs a lower open-ended **rectangleGate** based on selection of 1 point indicating the upper bound of the population. Boundary gates are supported in both 1 and 2 dimensions.
* `gate_threshold_draw` - constructs an upper open-ended **rectangleGate** based on selection of 1 point indicating the lower bound of the population. Threshold gates are supported in both 1 and 2 dimensions.
* `gate_interval_draw` - constructs **rectangleGate(s)** based on selection of 2 points indicating the lower and upper bounds of the population. Interval gates are supported in both 1 and 2 dimensions.
* `gate_ellipse_draw` - constructs **ellipsoidGate(s)** based on selection of 4 points indicating the lower and upper bounds of the population in 2 dimensions. 
* `gate_quadrant_draw` - constructs 4 open-ended **rectangleGates** based on selection of 1 point indicating the center of the crosshair between 4 populations. 
* `gate_web_draw` - constructs any number of **polygonGates** based on selection of a center point and surrounding separating points. See below for demonstration.
* `gate_draw` is a wrapper for all of these gating functions which takes on an argument `type` to indicate that type of gate to draw and construct.

## 2. Gating Arguments

All gating functions have the same format with minor variations as detailed below:

gate_draw(fr, channels, alias = NULL, display = 1, plot = TRUE, label = TRUE, ...)

* **type** of gate to be drawn, possible options include "rectangle", "polygon", "threshold", "boundary", "interval", "ellipse", "quadrant" and "web".
* **fr** an object of class `flowFrame` to be gated. For objects of classes `flowSet` and `GatingSet` refer to the more versatile `gate_draw` function.
* **channels** vector indicating the name(s) of the channel(s) to be used for gating.
* **alias** vector indicating the names of the population(s) to be gated. The length of the alias argument dictates the number of gates to construct. This argument **MUST** be supplied in order to construct the gates.
* **axis** used by drawInterval to specify whether the "x" or "y" axis should be used when constructing 2-D interval gates.
* **display** numeric [0,1] indicating the percentage of events to display when plotting, set to all events by default. If the supplied value is greater than the total number of events in the `flowFrame`, all events will be plotted.
* **plot** logical indicating whether a plot should be constructed, set to **TRUE** by default. This argument can be used to turn off plotting when mixing gating functions as detailed later.
* **label** logical indicating whether population names and statistics should be added to the plot after gating, set to **TRUE** by default.
* **...** additional arguments passed to cyto_plot for plotting.

## 3. Demonstration of Gating Functions

To demonstrate the use of CytoRSuite's gating functions we will use the "Activation" flowSet shipped with **CytoRSuiteData**. This flowSet contains 4 samples from an *in vitro* activation assay where activated dendritic cells pulsed with ovalbumin were used to stimulate OT-I (CD8+) and OT-II (CD4+) transgenic T cells. For more information about this `flowSet` see **?Activation**.

## 3.1 Prepare Samples for Gating
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Load in required packages
library(CytoRSuite)
library(CytoRSuiteData)

# Load in Activation dataset
fs <- Activation

# Extract spillover matrix from flowFrame description slot - see ?computeSpillover ?editSpillover
spill <- fs[[1]]@description$SPILL

# Apply compensation to samples & save to object fs
fs <- compensate(fs, spill)

# Apply logicle transformation to all fluorescent channels
trans <- estimateLogicle(fs[[1]], colnames(spill))
fs <- transform(fs, trans)

# We will use the pooled samples for gating - for large datasets use display to limit events for plotting
fr <- as(fs, "flowFrame")
```
